Project Overview
I'm excited to share my latest project where I utilized Tableau to analyze and visualize housing market trends in Washington. As a seasoned data analyst, this project allowed me to dive deep into the dataset and uncover valuable insights for stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making.

Objectives
Market Trends: Identify and analyze key housing market trends over time.
Price Analysis: Examine average house prices across different regions.
Sales Performance: Evaluate the performance of house sales across various metrics.
Insights for Stakeholders: Provide actionable insights to inform strategic decisions.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project included comprehensive information on house sales in Washington, such as:

Sale Price
Date of Sale
Location (Region, City)
Property Characteristics (Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Square Footage)
Year Built
Tools and Techniques
Tableau: For interactive data visualization and dashboard creation.
Data Cleaning: Using Tableauâ€™s built-in data preparation features to handle missing values, filter data, and ensure accuracy.
Visualization Techniques: Utilized bar charts, line graphs, heat maps, and scatter plots to represent data effectively.
Analysis Process
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Handled Missing Values: Ensured the dataset was clean by addressing any missing or inconsistent values.

Trend Analysis: Identified trends in house prices and sales volumes over time.
Regional Analysis: Compared house prices and sales performance across different regions and cities.
Property Characteristics: Analyzed how different property features (e.g., number of bedrooms, square footage) impacted sale prices.
3. Visualization and Insights
Key Visualizations
Line Graphs: Showed trends in average house prices over time.
Heat Maps: Illustrated regional variations in house prices and sales volumes.
